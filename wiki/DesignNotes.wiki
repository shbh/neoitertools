neoitertools is based on Top level interfaces and classes, lying in the top level package net.ericaro.neoitertools:

  * Protocol definition interface: interfaces that are used to define a [AboutGenerators protocol] for iterators.
    * [Generator Generator] : define the simplest generator protocol shared between java and python
    * YieldGenerator : defines the python generator protocol. But it can be used to implements java Iterators or Iterable
    * [Lambda Lambda] : the way to implement a lambda statement. until java7 and the promised Functor, it's the only way to do.
    * [Operator Operator] : operator ( like in reduce)
    * [Yield Yield] : to implement generator based on the [YieldStatement yield statement]
  * Immutable classes used as helper in interface definitions
    * [Index Index] : java way to handle enumerate
    * [Pair Pair]  : a 2-tuple with mixed types.
